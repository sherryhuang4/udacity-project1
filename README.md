# Installation <a name="installation"></a>
You will need the following libraries: **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib.pyplot**, **seaborn**, and **sklearn**.

# Project Motivation <a name="projectmotivation"></a>
For this project, I was interested in seeing if we could predict poverty rates for a country with some other health metrics. The features I originally had were: unemployment rate, birth rate, literacy rate, and overweight adults (%). I did drop the overweight adults feature, as it was not filled in well.

# File Descriptions <a name="filedescriptions"></a>
There are 2 files available here related to the above business question.

- _health_nutrition_population_data.csv_ - Data from the World Bank on poverty rate, unemployment rate, birth rate, literacy rate, and overweight adults (%) from countries around the world from 1960-2023.
- _project1.ipynb_ - Python Jupyter notebook that goes through the CRISP-DM process to address our business question. Markdown cells were added to describe each step of the process.

Data is from [the World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics). I am doing this work mainly for a project for a class I'm taking with [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com).
